Alerta
==========
A project from hackMIT

#What does Alerta do?

Alerta is an Android/Pebble combo to try and keep you safe in times of danger.

On the watch, all it is is one button. You tap the button on your watch, and it will send your emergency contacts a message that you've set previously, your geolocation(soon), and calls the police. All from the press of one button!

On the Phone, you select your emergency contacts and set a pre-set message on each one that will be sent when the button is pressed.
